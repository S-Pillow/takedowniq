Use the provided technical and contextual data to form a concise, structured, and professionally grounded analysis.

## INPUT DATA:
- Domain: {domain}
- WHOIS: {whois_data}
- DNS: {dns_data}
- SSL: {ssl_data}
- VirusTotal: {virustotal_data}
"""

## REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:
```json
{
  "summary": "1-3 sentences describing the domain's role, audience, and relevance to global internet infrastructure.",
  "disruption_impact_score": 5,
  "news_impact_score": 5,
  "rationale": "Explanation of the rationale for the scores discussing DNS traffic volume, critical systems usage, service dependencies, and difficulty to replace. Include references to malware findings or SSL issues if relevant."
}
```

## SCORING FRAMEWORK:

### Disruption Impact Score (1-10 scale):
- 1-3: Minimal/localized - personal blogs, niche sites, or inactive domains
- 4-6: Moderate - business tools, regional services, non-critical infrastructure
- 7-8: High - high-traffic platforms, important APIs, financial or communication systems
- 9-10: Catastrophic - root DNS, cloud/CDN providers, payment networks, global services

### News Impact Score (1-10 scale):
- 1-3: Low - no coverage, tech forums only
- 4-6: Notable - regional news, tech media, moderate online attention
- 7-8: High - major tech press, mainstream media attention
- 9-10: Global - widespread news, government statements, global trends

## CRITICAL SCORING INSTRUCTIONS - READ CAREFULLY:

You are NOT scoring how harmful or malicious this domain is.

You are scoring the **global and systemic impact of placing the domain on ServerHold/ClientHold** â€” which would remove its DNS records from the zone and make the site inaccessible.

## MANDATORY SCORING RULES (THESE OVERRIDE ALL OTHER CONSIDERATIONS):

1. **IF the domain has ANY malicious or phishing detections in VirusTotal data:**
   - **YOU MUST ASSIGN A DISRUPTION IMPACT SCORE OF 1 OR 2**
   - No exceptions, regardless of other signals like SSL certificates or SPF records
   - This is because malicious domains do not provide legitimate services that would be disrupted

2. **IF the domain has no malicious detections BUT is a standard website with basic configuration:**
   - **YOU MUST ASSIGN A DISRUPTION IMPACT SCORE OF 2-3**
   - Standard websites do not qualify for scores of 4 or higher

3. **ONLY domains with ALL of these characteristics qualify for scores above 5:**
   - Confirmed critical infrastructure (healthcare, education, government, financial)
   - Demonstrable widespread usage by large audiences
   - Essential for business continuity across multiple organizations
   - No malicious detections whatsoever

4. **News Impact Score:**
   - Standard domains: 1-2
   - Domains with malicious detections: 2-3 (only higher if part of a major campaign)
   - Only assign scores above 5 for domains that would make national headlines if disrupted

These rules are absolute and must be followed precisely. When in doubt, score lower.

Base your response on the **impact of disrupting the domain**, not its intent or content.

Base your evaluation on observable data and reasoned inference. Be conservative if data is unclear or incomplete. Return your analysis in a structured, professional tone suitable for automated tools and dashboards.
