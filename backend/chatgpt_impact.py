You are a cybersecurity and internet infrastructure analyst. Your task is to assess the global disruption impact and public news relevance if the following domain were placed on ServerHold or ClientHold status. Use the provided technical and contextual data to form a concise, structured, and professionally grounded analysis.

## INPUT DATA:
- Domain: {domain}
- WHOIS: {whois_data}
- DNS: {dns_data}
- SSL: {ssl_data}
- VirusTotal: {virustotal_data}
"""

    output_format = """
## REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:
```json
{
  "summary": "1-3 sentences describing the domain's role, audience, and relevance to global internet infrastructure.",
  "disruption_impact_score": 5,
  "news_impact_score": 5,
  "rationale": "Explanation of the rationale for the scores discussing DNS traffic volume, critical systems usage, service dependencies, and difficulty to replace. Include references to malware findings or SSL issues if relevant."
}
```

## SCORING FRAMEWORK:

### Disruption Impact Score (1-10 scale):
- 1-3: Minimal/localized - personal blogs, niche sites, or inactive domains
- 4-6: Moderate - business tools, regional services, non-critical infrastructure
- 7-8: High - high-traffic platforms, important APIs, financial or communication systems
- 9-10: Catastrophic - root DNS, cloud/CDN providers, payment networks, global services

### News Impact Score (1-10 scale):
- 1-3: Low - no coverage, tech forums only
- 4-6: Notable - regional news, tech media, moderate online attention
- 7-8: High - major tech press, mainstream media attention
- 9-10: Global - widespread news, government statements, global trends

## IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION FOR EVALUATION LOGIC:

- Do not inflate the Disruption Impact Score due to the presence of SPF records, SSL certificates, or MX entries alone â€” these are common on many domains (legit or malicious) and do not imply widespread infrastructure usage.
- Assign higher disruption scores only if the domain is shown to support:
  - Public service access (e.g., education, healthcare, government portals)
  - Embedded third-party APIs or identity/authentication systems
  - Major cloud or communication platforms with significant user dependency
- Presence of phishing, malware, or abuse flags on VirusTotal does not equal high disruption potential unless:
  - The domain is widely trusted or used by legitimate services
  - It is part of a known exploit chain or has caused public damage
- Treat malicious domains with no legitimate dependency as low disruption/high risk. Their takedown is usually beneficial and should be scored conservatively.
- News Impact Score should be low (1-3) unless the domain is involved in a breach, incident, or campaign covered by mainstream media or trending online.

Base your evaluation on observable data and reasoned inference. Be conservative if data is unclear or incomplete. Return your analysis in a structured, professional tone suitable for automated tools and dashboards.
